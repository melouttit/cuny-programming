		<h3>Start Your Website</h3>
		<p>Create a folder on your laptop somewhere easily accessible. You will create all your files in this folder, so it's important to know where you save it and to keep it organzied.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section>
	<section>
		<h2>What is a Website?</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Website Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Websites are simply an organized set of files.</li>
			<li>The files are stored on servers in <strong>directories</strong> (folders).</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>root</strong> folder is the most top-level folder with your content in directories or files within the root.</li>
			<li>The default page of a directory (site) is always <span class="code">index.html</span>, which is returned when no other file type is specified in the URL</li>
			<li>For example: <span class="code">http://mysite.com</span> will go to the same page as <span class="code">http://mysite.com/index.html</code></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<img src="http://mlouttit.com/cuny/images/folder-structure.gif" width="300"/>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Disect Directory Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each image and file on the page has a URL under that site's domain</li>
			<li>The URL path points to the particular file or directory you want retrieve</li>
			<li>Find the following in the example site:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="code">http://mysite.com/writing</span> links to the Writing page</li>
					<li><span class="code">http://mysite.com/about.html</span> links to the About page</li>
					<li><span class="code">http://mysite.com/images/artoo.jpg</span> is the path to the artoo.jpg image</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Create Your Homepage</h3>
		<p>Open Sublime and start a new file. Save this file to your site's root directory and name it <span class="code">index.html</span>. This will be your site's homepage.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>File Extensions</h3>
		<p>The file extension simply tells your text editor and the browser what type of file (what language) it's opening and displaying. Your file extension should match the language you're writing in. In this class, we will primarily be working with three file extensions: <span class="code">.html</span>, <span class="code">.css</span>, <span class="code">.js</span>

		<h2>Local v. Remote</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Your Local Website</h3>
		<p>This is the directory for your site that is stored on your machine. You can access it by viewing your index file in a web browser, but no one else can see it.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Your Live Website</h3>
		<p>When you upload your site files to a server via FTP, they are then considered "live" and can be accessed by anyone who has the URL.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Tip</h3>
		<p>It is best to work on your site locally and then upload changes, as opposed to working live.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>View Your Local Website</h3>
		<p>Type <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;</span> in your <span class="code">index.html</span> file, save it, and open in a browser.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section>
	<section>
		<h2>Site Maps</h2>
		<p>A "family tree" style chart that outlines the pages and content on your website and how they relate to each other. Your pages will correspond to directories and files within your website.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site+maps&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=IwkeUqeUIu62sASAuID4Bw&ved=0CFQQsAQ&biw=1824&bih=1079">Examples</a></h2>
		<p>Each entry is a directory or page on your site</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Git Workshop</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Final Project</h2>
	<p>By the end of the fifth week (March 9) you will have to have completed the basic archiecture and design of a webpage. This page can house content you've already created or content you intend to create (projects are always better when they have a real-world purpose). The idea is to start simple and continually build on your project with the knowledge that you gain throughout this course.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<section>
		<h2>Assignments</h2>
		<p>In the Assignments directory in the class Dropbox, there will be a folder for each week. In each week, create a folder giving it your last name as the folder name. This is where you will upload all your assignments for that week.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Readings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Read the first chapter in HTML&CSS. If you don't have the book yet you can <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/sample-chapter/">read the first chapter free online</a>.</li>
			<li>Add to your homepage (<span class="code">index.html</span>) the four HTML tags that make up the basic structure of a webpage.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Worksheet</h3>
		<p>Download the document from Dropbox called <span class="code">weekone_worksheet.docx</span> and save a copy to your computer. Fill in the answers and upload to your folder in Dropbox.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Final Project Proposal</h3>
		<p>Brainstorm the project you want to begin creating for this class. Download the file <span class="code">weekone_proposal.docx</span> and save a copy to your computer. Use this file as a guide for writing your proposal. Your proposal should be detailed and will answer the questions posed. Consider all content you might need and how that content might be organized.</p>
