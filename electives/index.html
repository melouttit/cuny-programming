  <h1>Programming for Journalists</h1>
  <p>An introduction to the three most used languages in front-end development - HTML, CSS and JavaScript - that connects these technologies to how they are used in modern newsrooms to do journalism.</p>

  <h2>You will NOT</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Become a programmer (yet)</li>
    <li>Become a designer (yet)</li>
    <li>Become a hacker (yet?)</li>
    <li>Use interface tools to build anything</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>You WILL Learn...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How the Internet works</li>
    <li>How to build a website from scratch</li>
    <li>How to use Git to develop and host a project</li>
    <li>Basic design principles</li>
    <li>To write basic HTML, CSS and JS from scratch</li>
    <li>How these technologies work together</li>
    <li>How to use your computer's CLI</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Goal</h2>
  <p>This course is an attempt to not only introduce you to programming, but to strip away the mystery behind how the Internet works, how files are created, how websites are stored and served, and to introduce you to common newsroom workflows for digital projects. We will use tools and systems that you will come across in most newsrooms today.</p>

  <p>The goal is to make you familiar with the underlying processes so that as these tools inevitably evolve and change over time, you will have the base understanding and ability to troubleshoot that will allow you to adapt to these changes.</p>
