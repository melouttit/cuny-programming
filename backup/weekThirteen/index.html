				<h2>Week 13 | Dec. 3, 2014</h2>
				<h4>jQuery Plugins</h4>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>FTP</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>protocol: SFTP</li>
					<li>host: digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu</li>
					<li>user: your network user name</li>
					<li>pw: their network password</li>
					<li>All files must be stored in the public_html folder</li>
					<li>URL: http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/<em>yourusername</em>/path/to/file</li>
				</ul> 
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>jQuery Plugins</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A common set of jQuery functions that can be added to your site for quick functionality</li>
					<li>Anyone can write a plugin and release it for widespread use. Most will include documentation on how to implement and what custimzation is available to you</li>
					<li><a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/">The jQuery plugin registry</a> is a good starting point for seeing what is available.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Adding a Plugin</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Download the plugin code from the source. On the homepage for your plugin, look for a download link.</li>
					<li>Usually plugins will come with at least one JavaScript file, a CSS file and sometimes an images directory and README file.</li>
					<li>Read the instructions for installing carefully. For most plugins, you will just include the source JS and CSS files on the page you want to instantiate the plugin on.</li>
					<li>Make sure the jQuery library is on the page before the plugin</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Minified JS</h2>
				<p>You might see two JS files in the plugin you download with filenames that are similar except for a <span class="code">-min</span> at the end. This means the owner is providing you with two ways to include their JS. The file with the <span class="code">-min</span> at the end is the minified version, meaning it's stripped of white space and lighter to download. You would only want the unminified version if you were planning on altering the plugin. Open both files to see the difference.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Demos</h2>
				<p>Many plugins also provide demo pages or have demos working on their page. Use the inspector to see how they set up the demos as a guide to setting up your own.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Example</h2>
					<p>Using <a href="http://rygine.com/projects/looper.js/docs/">Looper.js</a> to create a box for rotating photos.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Download setup</h3>
					<p>First, download the jquerytest folder from Week 13 in Dropbox. There will be an index file and folder of five images.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Download Plugin Files</h3>
					<p>On the plugin site, click download and save to your jquerytest folder. These are all the files the plugin creator has provided to get the plugin working and for any customization.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Arrange the Files</h3>
					<p>In your site directory you can keep all the files in the plugin folder, or you can grab the files you need and put them in the relevant <span class="code">js</span> and <span class="code">css</span> directories on your site. Just remember where you put them so you can refer to them later.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Add files to your page</h3>
					<p>In your index file, add the css and js files you need to your page. Also make sure jQuery is on the page. Styles should go in the head tags and scripts can go either in the head or below your html (but still in the body tag).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Write your HTML</h3>
					<p>Most plugins will require that you structure your HTML in a certain way and sometimes include certain classes for styling. This information will be in the README files or demos.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Instantiation</h3>
					<p>Create an instance of the feature you're including via JavaScript. Most of the time you will do this by calling a custom method on the div where you want your plugin to appear.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Options</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Beyond the standard setup, most plugins have options you can pass in to the customize the plugin.</li>
						<li>You will need to read through the plugins documentation to find the options that are available to you.</li>
						<li>The plugin owner might also provide several stylesheets for you to choose from so you can customize the look of the plugin.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Assignment</h2>
				<p>Look through the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/">jQuery plugin directory</a> and search through Google to find a plugin that you want to implement on your site. Fill in the worksheet in Week 13 - you'll need the name and website of your plugin, why you want to use it and what starting materials you'll need to implement it. Download the files and gather anything else you'll need to get started in preparation for next class.</p>
