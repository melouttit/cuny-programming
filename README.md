<h3>A Note on Learning</h3>
<p>This course is an attempt to not only introduce you to programming, but to strip away the mystery behind how the Internet works, how files are created, how websites are stored and served, and to introduce to you the development process behind most web apps and projects. We will use tools and systems that you will come across in most newsrooms today. The goal is to make you familiar with the underlying processes so that as these tools inevitably evolve and change over time you will have the base understanding that will allow you to adapt to these changes.</p>

<h3>Homework & Workshops</h3>
<p>This course will be structured around short exercises demonstrating various concepts and methods in markup, styling and programming. There will be reading and guided exercises assigned for homework and plenty of in-class practice. The homework assignments are meant to introduce you to terms and concepts while the workshops are meant to help you practice and troubleshoot while you have the help of instructors.</p>
<p>Programming can be tedious and you will get frustrated at times - don't let that scare you. Even the most seasoned programmers make minor mistakes. The trick is knowing how to problem solve so you can catch those mistakes quickly. This will likely be the most valuable thing you learn in this course.</p>

<h2>HTML/CSS Weeks 1-5</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1 Introduction, Tools, What is a Website? (2/1):</strong> Introduction to the class, go over class objectives and why coding is important in journalism. Then we will make sure everyone has the programs necessary for the next 15 weeks downloaded and accounts set up (Sublime, Slack, iTerm, Git). The last part of the class will focus on how website files get served and basic page setup. <strong>GIT Lab:</strong> Get set up and running locally.</li>
  <!--HW: Read Chapters 2-3, set up your first page-->
  <li><strong>2 HTML & Wireframes (2/8):</strong> Introduction of HTML as a markup language, how to write it and common tags needed for building a page. <strong>GIT Lab:</strong> Learn how to add/commit/push. </li>
  <!--WORKSHOP three additions to a markup page, and commit those changes-->
  <!--HOMEWORK read chapters XX-XX, find a structured page to re-create-->
  <li><strong>3 CSS & The Inspector (2/22):</strong> Introduce how to use CSS and how to write it and include it on a page. We also introduce the console and how to inspect sites and check changes. <strong>GIT Lab:</strong> Continue practicing add/commit/push</li>
  <!--WORKSHOP three style changes, add to the page and push to repo-->
  <!--HOMEWORK read chapters XX-XX, style your structured page with columns-->
  <li><strong>4 Positioning <!--Jue-->(2/29*):</strong> Today we go over the various properties that control the positioning of elements on your page, using the homework from last week as a base. <strong>GIT Lab:</strong> Continue practicing add/commit/push and learn pull.</li>
  <!--WORKSHOP redo homework to make sure it's right, other positioning lessons?-->
  <!--HOMEWORK read chapters XX-XX, three elements on a page with different positioning-->
  <li><strong>5 Design Basics & Workshop (3/7):</strong> Learn about a few design basics that inform good graphic design. The second part of class will be a workshop where students will re-create a page from scratch using markup and styles they have learned in class. <strong>GIT Lab:</strong> Continue practicing pull/add/commit/push</li>
  <!--workshop: full page/site-->
  <!--HOMEWORK reading for javascript-->
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript Weeks 6-15</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>6 What is JavaScript? (3/14):</strong> Discussing JavaScript as a language, how it was created and it’s current place in modern web technology. We will go over what it is used for and how it can be incorporated into journalism projects. We will also discuss its relationship to the Document Object Model and how to add it to the students’ websites. </li>
  <!-- debugging tips / finding the error -->
  <!-- small exercises for each class -->
  <!-- <li><strong>7 Arrays, Objects & Loops (3/21):</strong> Continuing with basic JavaScript vocabulary, we cover various ways of storing data and variables for use in our code, and how to loop through them to perform actions. We will apply our JavaScript knowledge so far to the writing of a tip calculator, using <strong>git</strong> to pull files.</li>
  <li><strong>8 Introduction to Frameworks (3/28):</strong> Discussing the difference between JavaScript and the various frameworks available to use to manage complex actions more efficiently, focusing specifically on using jQuery. We will download the jQuery library, add it to the students’ websites, and practice some basic methods. During the last part of class we will re-write our app from the week before in jQuery and learn how to create a new branch in <strong>git</strong> and manage it within a repo.</li>
  <li><strong>9 Methods & Plugin Practice (4/4):</strong> This week we will go over a few more jQuery methods that we have at our disposal students will present to each other. The second part of class will go over how jQuery plugins work and how they can quickly be added to a website to enhance interactivity.</li>
  <li><strong>10 Data Types & AJAX (4/11):</strong> We will discuss two of the most popular ways of storing data - XML and JSON - and how to use AJAX to grab data and display it on our page. We will practice writing our own data files to learn the syntax. At the end of class, students will be grouped for a collaborative data project.</li>
  <li><strong>11 Underscore & Data (4/18):</strong> We will introduce another JavaScript framework, Underscore, that has useful methods for organizing data. We will use publicly available data to practice will some of these new methods. At the end of class, groups will get their data assignments.</li>
  <li><strong>12 Collaboration Workshop (5/2):</strong> Students will come prepared to work collaboratively on a small app, they will split the work between getting the data ready, displaying and designing it, using <strong>git</strong> to manage their work. A <strong>git</strong> workshop will go over pulling and merging.</li>
  <li><strong>13 Collaboration Workshop 2 (5/9):</strong> Students will put the finishing touches on their app.</li>
  <li><strong>14 Multimedia (5/16):</strong> We will go over some HTML and JavaScript options for including video and audio files on our page.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Workshop (5/23):</strong> Using the project created in the HTML/CSS module, students will write either native javascript, jQuery or use plugins to add at least two types of functionality to their project.</li> -->
