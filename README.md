<h3>A Note on Learning</h3>
<p>This course is an attempt to not only introduce you to programming, but to strip away the mystery behind how the Internet works, how files are created, how websites are stored and served, and to introduce to you the development process behind most web apps and projects. We will use tools and systems that you will come across in most newsrooms today. The goal is to make you familiar with the underlying processes so that as these tools inevitably evolve and change over time you will have the base understanding that will allow you to adapt to these changes.</p>

<h3>The Final Project</h3>
<p>You will create a (at minimum) one-page project that will by the end of the first five weeks have the basic artchitecture and design set up, and by the end the of semester have multiple interactions handled via javascript. The first week will be dedicated to proposing your project. Start simple.</p>

<h2>HTML/CSS Weeks 1-5</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1 Introduction, Tools, What is a Website? (2/2):</strong> We introduce the class, go over class objectives and why coding is important in journalism. Then we will make sure everyone has the programs necessary for the next 15 weeks downloaded and accounts et up (Dropbox, Sublime, Slack). The last part of the class will focus on how website files get served and basic page setup.</li>
  <li><strong>2 HTML & Wireframes (2/9):</strong> Introduction of HTML as a markup language, how to write it and common tags needed for starting a page. The last part of class will be a lab hour getting students set up on GitHub, where they will commit their work.</li>
  <li><strong>3 CSS: & Design Basics (2/18*):</strong> Introduce how to use CSS and how to write it and include it on a page. We also introduce the console and how to inspect sites and check changes. The last part of class focuses on design basics to help get students started on envisioning their final project.</li>
  <li><strong>4 Positioning (2/23):</strong> Today we go over the various properties that control the positioning of elements on your page. The second part of class will be a workshop where we students’ final projects architected on the page.</li>
  <li><strong>5 SEO & Workshop (3/2):</strong> A quick lesson on meta tags and how they, in addition to URLs, figure into SEO performance. The second part of class is more workshop time to get students close to finishing their final project.</li>

We will also discuss its relationship to the Document Object Model and how to add it to the students’ websites. </li>
  <li><strong>7 Arrays, Objects & Loops (3/16):</strong> Continuing with basic JavaScript vocabulary, we cover various ways of storing data and variables for use in our code, and how to loop through them to perform actions. We will apply our JavaScript knowledge so far to the writing of a tip calculator, using <strong>git</strong> to pull files.</li>
  <li><strong>8 Introduction to Frameworks (3/23):</strong> Discussing the difference between JavaScript and the various frameworks available to use to manage complex actions more efficiently, focusing specifically on using jQuery. We will download the jQuery library, add it to the students’ websites, and practice some basic methods. During the last part of class we will re-write our app from the week before in jQuery and learn how to create a new branch in <strong>git</strong> and manage it within a repo.</li>
  <li><strong>9 Methods & Plugin Practice (3/30):</strong> This week we will go over a few more jQuery methods that we have at our disposal students will present to each other. The second part of class will go over how jQuery plugins work and how they can quickly be added to a website to enhance interactivity.</li>
  <li><strong>10 Data Types & AJAX (4/13):</strong> We will discuss two of the most popular ways of storing data - XML and JSON - and how to use AJAX to grab data and display it on our page. We will practice writing our own data files to learn the syntax. At the end of class, students will be grouped for a collaborative data project.</li>
  <li><strong>11 Underscore & Data (4/20):</strong> We will introduce another JavaScript framework, Underscore, that has useful methods for organizing data. We will use publicly available data to practice will some of these new methods. At the end of class, groups will get their data assignments.</li>
  <li><strong>12 Collaboration Workshop (4/27):</strong> Students will come prepared to work collaboratively on a small app, they will split the work between getting the data ready, displaying and designing it, using <strong>git</strong> to manage their work. A <strong>git</strong> workshop will go over pulling and merging.</li>
  <li><strong>13 Collaboration Workshop 2 (5/4):</strong> Students will put the finishing touches on their app.</li>
  <li><strong>14 Multimedia (5/11):</strong> We will go over some HTML and JavaScript options for including video and audio files on our page.</li>
  <li><strong>FINAL PROJECT:</strong> Using the project created in the HTML/CSS module, students will write either native javascript, jQuery or use plugins to add at least two types of functionality to their project. <strong>DUE: Monday 5/18</strong></li>
